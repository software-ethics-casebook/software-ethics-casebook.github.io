<h2 id="context-and-discussion">Context and Discussion</h2>
<p>This IETF memo gives a technical definition of Pervasive Monitoring and unambiguously considers it an <em>attack</em> on the privacy of the user, in the technical sense that the party carrying out the monitoring is recording or modifying a user’s communication in a way that subverts the user’s intent. Having acknowledged this threat, the IETF, as a standards development organisation, commits to give ensure that the development of standards takes the mitigation of Pervasive Monitoring into account.</p>
